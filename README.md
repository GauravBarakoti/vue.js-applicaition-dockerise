# Single-Page Application in Vue.js

SPA, some applications require rich interactivity, deep session depth, and non-trivial stateful logic on the frontend. The best way to build such applications is to use an architecture where Vue not only controls the entire page, but also handles data updates and navigation without having to reload the page. This type of application is typically referred to as a Single-Page Application (SPA).

In short, a single-page application is an app that doesnâ€™t need to reload the page during its use and works within a browser.

In my case, I have a sample Single Page Application of Vue.js.

Our goal here, is to Dockerise this application and push the Image to Amazon ECR and then deploy it using ECS Fargate.
